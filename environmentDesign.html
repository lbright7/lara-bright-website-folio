	<h4>During 2020, I designed an environment in Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4 which included 3D models made in Autodesk's Maya.</h4>
	<h3>I had used these applications to create my character design:</h3>
	<h3>- Pencil and paper<br>
	    - Adobe Photoshop<br>
		- Autodesk Maya<br>
		- Unreal Engine 4<br>
    </h3>
	<h3>My creative process is detailed below.</h3>
	</div>
	<p>My design process begun with brainstorming ideas for the game environment with suitable assets to include in it.  Batman Arkham Asylum has heavily contributed to influencing my design and ideas of the environment. I was inspired to create an atmosphere that is grungy and abandoned that evokes strange emotions.</p>
	<div><img id="EnvironmentImgRotate" src="Images/FolioImages/GameEnvironmentMindmap.png" alt="Environment Room Elaborate Mindmap"></div>
	<p>Then, I decided upon three assets to include within this environment of an 'Haunted Asylum/Adandoned Bedroom'. The bedroom was to correlate with 1950's mental asylums, the pipe invokes a rancid environment and the bars to represent confinement.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/GameThumbnailSketches.PNG" alt="Sketches of a bed, pipe and window bars"></div>
	<p>Then with Adobe Photoshop, I coloured my sketches to visualise them properly as suitable to the environment.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/GameThumbnailDigital.PNG" alt="Digitised sketches of a bed, pipe and window bars"></div>
	<p>Then, from there I finalised my abandoned bedroom design with three possible sketches that displayed different layouts with the three assets.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/GameBedroomSketch.png" alt="Three designs of an asylum bedroom"></div>
	<p>Then, after deciding upon a design for the bedroom, I drew a three-point perspective of the room to understand proportions and angles of the assets residing in the room.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/EnvironmentBedroomSketch.png" alt="Three point perspective asylum room design sketch"></div>
	<p>I then digitised the sketch on Adobe Photoshop as I had previously accomplished with my asset sketches and coloured the scene appropriately (with a colour scheme I had desired).</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/EnvironmentBedroomDigital.png" alt="Three point perspective asylum room design digitised"></div>
	<p>The assets were blocked out on Autodesk Maya with polygons.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/MayaBlockouts.PNG" alt="3D Maya Blockouts of a bed, pipe and two sets of window bars"></div>
	<p>Then, to achieve accurate proportions of the assets, I had imported them into an empty Unreal Engine 4 project against the game character's height and width.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/AssetsComparedToCharacter.PNG" alt="3D Maya Blockouts of bed, pipe and two sets of window bars"></div>
	<p>Satisfied with the proportions, I blocked out the entire environment in the Unreal Engine 4 project - the wall and floor comprising of grey boxes.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/UE4Blockout.png" alt="Unreal Engine 4 3D blockout of bedroom with three assets"></div>
	<p>I then textured my 3D models in Maya with textures I had made and thoroughly edited in Adobe Photoshop. <br><br> The bed was textured with a solid black material and I digitally painted silver/grey specks and lines where the folds would be on a metal bed to exaggerate the deterioration stage of the bed to evoke the abandonded atmosphere.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/BEDFRAME.PNG" alt="3D Maya Model of bed textured in black"></div>
	<p>I also textured the security window bars with a metallic black material in Maya.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/BarsTextured.png" alt="3D Maya Models of two sets of window bars textured in black"></div>
	<p>I found a royalty free image for the pipe texture, however, I thoroughly edited it in Photoshop (changing different hues and colours, removing colours, adding colours to alter the perception)</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/Pipe snipping.PNG" alt="3D Maya Model of pipe textured in chipped green paint colour"></div>
	<p>I had to UV unwrap each individual 3D model to accurately textualise each asset.</p>
	<div><img class="EnvironmentImg" src="Images/FolioImages/UV.PNG" alt="UV Unwraps in Maya of bed"></div>
	<p>After texturing the assets, I put them in the environment as I had envisioned from my digitised sketch. Then in Unreal Engine 4, I textured the walls with a free material I had edited in Photoshop. I also altered the sky box to appear dark (purple/black) and added a particle system to set the grungy atmosphere. I was thoroughly happy with the end result as it fit my own specified brief exceeding expectations. </p>

	<p>In the previous task, I also used Autodesk Maya to create a flask 3D model to accomodate a survival/exploration game.</p>
