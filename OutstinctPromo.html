		  <h2>O u t s t i n c t .</h2>
		  <p> In the future, when the Earth’s resources have depleted and the ozone layer starts breaking to a point it cannot be repaired, the deadly UV rate has skyrocketed and the air is not safe to breathe. Though the space race has started and humankind has colonised Mars, ‘Enigma’ needs to stay on Earth to scientifically monitor the planet. Throughout a day in their life with a coloured helmet and full body suit, the player experiences many different scenarios to challenge their predetermined beliefs as our character listens (or does not listen) to the voice; an unreliable narrator.</p><br>

        <h4 class="item-2">Why does music make you feel?</h4>
        <h4 class="item-3">Be prepared to use your senses.</h4>
		  
		  <p> In this adventure/exploration game, the player-character will decide what they believe is ‘right’ and will help find who the character truly is and if they get to go to Mars, or if it is better to stay on Earth. Whilst exploring climate change and societal stances, the player-character will be transported to many different areas including the past, giving the opportunity to explore their own instinct and freewill. However, the narrator is unpredictable and can persuade the player to do certain things. The narrator can also begin the game from where they want if a ‘wrong’ decision is made. There will be doors that lead into the same room, there will be eternal mazes and indistinctive puzzles to be discovered, and most importantly there will be challenging of internal instinct. </p><h3>Enigma is waiting for you.</h3> 
		  <p> Watch your coloured helmet and listen to the environment around you. Valuable lessons are to be learned. Be prepared to expect the unexpected. The game has many different endings, and only you can pick what is the ‘correct’ one for you. We will persuade you that your instinct will be outstinct.</p>
